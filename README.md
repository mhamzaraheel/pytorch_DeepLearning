# pytorch_DeepLearning

## Overview

<div align="justify">
  
> This repository contains my work for a comprehensive deep learning course, organized into five distinct parts. Throughout the course, I delved into fundamental concepts and advanced techniques in deep learning, gaining practical insights and hands-on experience. Each part of the project corresponds to a specific module.
> Below is the basic description of what I have done in all parts.

In this comprehensive exploration of PyTorch fundamentals, I delved into the essence of tensors, covering their creation, randomness, and manipulation. Navigated through tensor attributes, fundamental operations, and advanced techniques such as reshaping and indexing. The tutorial extended to crucial aspects like interoperability with NumPy arrays, ensuring reproducibility, and optimizing computations by harnessing the power of GPUs.

## 2. [PyTorch WorkFlow:](https://github.com/mhamzaraheel/pytorch_DeepLearning/blob/main/NooteBooks/2_pytorch_workflow.ipynb)

In this part, I covered the essential steps of building and training a PyTorch model for simple linear regression. Beginning with data preparation and visualization, I created a dataset and split it into training and testing sets. Moving on to the model building, I constructed a linear regression model using PyTorch, obtained model information and made predictions using inference mode. The training process involved defining a loss function, optimizer, and implementing training and testing loops. Finally, I learned to save and load the model using PyTorch's state_dict. Bringing it all together, I successfully executed the complete workflow, emphasizing data handling, model construction, training, prediction, and model persistence.
