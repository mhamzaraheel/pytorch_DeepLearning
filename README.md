# pytorch_DeepLearning

## Overview

<div align="justify">
  
> This repository contains my work for a comprehensive deep learning course, organized into five distinct parts. Throughout the course, I delved into fundamental concepts and advanced techniques in deep learning, gaining practical insights and hands-on experience. Each part of the project corresponds to a specific module.
> Below is the basic description of what I have done in all parts.

## 1. [PyTorch Fundamentals:](https://github.com/mhamzaraheel/pytorch_DeepLearning/blob/main/NooteBooks/1%23pyTorch_Fundamentals.ipynb)
<div align="justify">
In this comprehensive exploration of PyTorch fundamentals, I delved into the essence of tensors, covering their creation, randomness, and manipulation. Navigated through tensor attributes, fundamental operations, and advanced techniques such as reshaping and indexing. The tutorial extended to crucial aspects like interoperability with NumPy arrays, ensuring reproducibility, and optimizing computations by harnessing the power of GPUs.
