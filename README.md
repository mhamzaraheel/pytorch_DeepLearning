# pytorch_DeepLearning

## Overview

<div align="justify">
  
> This repository contains my work for a comprehensive deep learning course, organized into five distinct parts. Throughout the course, I delved into fundamental concepts and advanced techniques in deep learning, gaining practical insights and hands-on experience. Each part of the project corresponds to a specific module.
> Below is the basic description of what I have done in all parts.

<div align="justify">
In this comprehensive exploration of PyTorch fundamentals, I delved into the essence of tensors, covering their creation, randomness, and manipulation. Navigated through tensor attributes, fundamental operations, and advanced techniques such as reshaping and indexing. The tutorial extended to crucial aspects like interoperability with NumPy arrays, ensuring reproducibility, and optimizing computations by harnessing the power of GPUs.

<div align="justify">
In this part, I covered the essential steps of building and training a PyTorch model for simple linear regression. Beginning with data preparation and visualization, I created a dataset and split it into training and testing sets. Moving on to the model building, I constructed a linear regression model using PyTorch, obtained model information and made predictions using inference mode. The training process involved defining a loss function, optimizer, and implementing training and testing loops. Finally, I learned to save and load the model using PyTorch's state_dict. Bringing it all together, I successfully executed the complete workflow, emphasizing data handling, model construction, training, prediction, and model persistence.

<div align="justify">
In the third session, I built and trained a PyTorch neural network for classification tasks. Data preparation, model architecture, loss functions, and optimizers. The training process included raw output to predicted label transformation and thorough testing. Model improvement strategies involved adding layers, adjusting hidden units, and exploring linear and non-linear data representations. I extended our capabilities to multi-class classification, introducing a comprehensive training loop. The session concluded with a diverse set of classification evaluation metrics, providing a comprehensive guide to implementing and enhancing PyTorch classification models.

<div align="justify">
In the fourth part of our  "Computer Vision", I explored the applications of computer vision, PyTorch libraries, dataset preparation, and model building. Began with understanding data shapes and visualizing data, followed by DataLoader implementation. Model 1, a baseline model, was created with training/testing loops and performance evaluation. Device-agnostic code was introduced, leading to Model 2, a non-linear model, and the subsequent development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Model 3. The section concluded with model comparisons, random predictions, confusion matrix creation, and saving/loading the best-performing model, providing a comprehensive guide to PyTorch-based image classification.
